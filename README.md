# Hunter Lab 🧪

Welcome to **Hunter Lab** — my personal collection of **mini-projects, experiments, and scripts**.  
This isn’t a polished monorepo, but more of a **sandbox** where I learn, test ideas, and build small things that don’t need a repo of their own.

The structure may change at any time, so treat this repo as a **living archive of experiments**.

---

## 🌟 Highlights

- 🎮 **Mini Games** → Tic Tac Toe (React & Vanilla), sliders, and more
- ⚡ **Scripts** → Utilities for quick automation or testing
- 🎨 **UI Experiments** → Animations, styling experiments, and small frontend builds
- 🧑‍💻 **Playground** → Where I try out frameworks, libraries, and new tech

---

## 📂 Current Layout

> ⚠️ Subject to change — I move things around often!

- **React/** → Mini React-based projects (e.g. TicTacToe with components and hooks)
- **Vanilla/** → Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS builds (e.g. Infinite Slider, TicTacToe)
- **scripts/** → Handy scripts (small tools, wrappers, experiments)
- **public/** → Shared/static assets (images, test resources, etc.)

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🖥️ Web Projects (React/Vanilla)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/kishore399/Hunter-lab.git
cd Hunter-lab

# Go to a project folder, e.g. React/TicTacToe
cd React/TicTacToe

# Install dependencies if package.json exists
npm install

# Run locally
npm run dev
```

### ⚙️ Scripts

```bash
cd scripts

# Example for Node.js scripts
node myscript.js
```

## 🔄 Philosophy

This repo is like a **sketchbook for code**:

- Some projects are **complete mini-apps**
- Others are **half-finished experiments**
- Some are just **quick scripts** I wanted to save

It’s not about polish, but about **learning, experimenting, and iterating**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack I Often Use

- **Frontend** → React, Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, Tailwind
- **Build Tools** → Vite, npm, Node.js
- **Scripting** → JavaScript (Node.js)

## 🙌 Note

If you stumble upon something broken, unfinished, or oddly placed — that’s normal.  
This is **my lab**, and labs are messy, experimental, and always changing ⚡
