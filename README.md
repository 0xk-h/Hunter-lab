# 🛠️ Practice Playground

Welcome to my personal practice repository!

This is where I explore new ideas, build small apps, and clone simple projects to sharpen my skills. Most of these are for learning purposes and aren't production-grade.

---

## 📁 Project List

| # | Project Name | Description | Link |
|---|--------------|-------------|------|
| 1 | Vanilla-TicTacToe | A simple tic-tac-toe game built from scratch | [View](./XO%20game) |
| 2 | React-TicTacToe | Same cleaner ui, centralized logic and reusable components | [View](./React_XO) |


<!-- Add more projects below as you build -->

---

## 🔧 Setup

Most projects are self-contained, but depending on the folder:

- React: `npm install && npm run dev`
- Vanilla: Open `index.html` directly

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

Projects here may include:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js (as needed)

---

## 📌 Notes

- This is my personal sandbox for practice.
- Feel free to explore the code, but it's not meant to be perfect or production-ready.
